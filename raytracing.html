      RayTracing Extension
    </h1>
    <p>
        The RayTracing extension provides an interface with the popular open-source <a href="http://www.povray.org/">POV-Ray</a> ray tracing rendering engine.
        This allows Netlogo users to create more elaborate visualizations of their models, including shadows, reflection, refraction,
        texture mapping, and more.  
        It also supports creating images with arbitrarily high resolution, which is especially useful for creating print-quality graphics.
        The RayTracing extension can be used both in Netlogo 2D and Netlogo 3D, although it is generally more effective when using NetLogo 3D.
    <h2>
      Getting set up
    </h2>
    <p> First, you need to (separately) install <a href="http://www.povray.org/">POV-Ray</a> on your computer.  
POV-Ray runs on Windows, Mac, and Linux.  However, support for modern Intel-based Macs seems to somewhat sketchy at present, and this extension has only been (lightly) tested on Windows and Linux. (Mac users may want to try the directions <a href="http://www.antonraves.com/megapov11_on_osx.html">here</a>, because the raytracing extension needs a version of POV-Ray that supports command line usage.)
	<p> Second, you need to edit the file <i>raytracing.config.txt</i>, which is in the raytracing extension folder, and set the correct path to your installed POV-Ray program. 
    <h2>
      How to use
    </h2>
    <p>
     To use the Raytracing Extension in your model, add a line to the top of your procedures tab:
    <pre>
extensions [raytracing]
</pre>
    <p>
    For the most basic usage, choose an appropriate perspective in the 3D view, and then issue the command:
<pre>
  raytracing:render "output_file_name"  10
</pre>
    <p>
For more information about rendering primitive, see the <a href="#raytracing:render">raytracing:render</a> documentation below.
GENERAL TIP: Save your model before rendering, just in case -- to prevent lost work in case povray hangs/crashes/takes hours to finish.
    <p>
    For more information on using Netlogo extensions, see the <a href="extensions.html">Extensions Guide</a>.

It's as if you had just loaded the raytracing extension anew, and everything is fresh.  
      <p>(Note: In contrast to NetLogo's CLEAR-ALL primitive, this command does *not* change any properties of the NetLogo world-- it only affects the special settings controlled by the raytracing extension.)

        If you don't add any lights to the scene, the scene will still be illuminated by 
        a combination of low ambient light, as well as a "headlamp" placed by the camera location.
        (The headlamp is only used if you haven't added any lights to the scene.)

        Sets the reflection rate for a individual agent.  
        A perfect mirror would be 1.0, and no reflection (default) would be 0.0.
        Glossy/metallic surfaces should fall somewhere in between.

      <p>
        set the index of refraction for an individual agent. 
        This setting only affects transparent objects, and causes the light to bend by a certain amount when it passes through.
        (Air has a refraction index of 1.0 (no bending), whereas water is 1.33, glass is 1.5 and diamond is 2.4.  Values less than 1.0 are possible as well.)

        The threshold may be between 3.0 and 0.0, with lower thresholds corresponding to more antialiasing.  The default threshold is 0.3.

        render the scene with the specified output file name (leave off the filename extension - it will be added automatically to create <i>output-file-name.POV</i> and <i></i>output-file-name.PNG</i> ) and <i>quality-level</i> (quality-level 10 is full/normal output - lower numbers will be lower quality, but will render more quickly.  quality-levels 11 and 12 provide slightly higher quality due to jittering and additional antialiased supersampling, but should not be used for creating animations, because the random jittering may vary from frame to frame.)
       <p>Note: The <i>output-file-name</i> path specified is interpreted as relative to the folder that the currently open model is saved in.  However, if the model hasn't been saved yet, the user's home folder may be used for output instead.

      <p> Similar to RENDER above, except that it creates sequentially numbered image files, based on the movie-file-name-stem and quality-level given to the START-MOVIE command.
      Also, it renders all the images quietly in the background (at least on Linux) to prevent POV-Ray windows from popping up over and over again.

    <p>
	The idea for the raytracing extension was conceived by <a href="http://forrest.stonedahl.com/">Forrest Stonedahl</a>, and the first version was implemented in an independent study course project by Rumou Duan at Northwestern University, under the supervision of Forrest Stonedahl and Uri Wilensky.  If you would like to contribute to this project, the <a href="https://github.com/fstonedahl/RayTracing-Extension">open source code</a> is available from GitHub, and patches/developers are most welcome.
