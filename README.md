# NetLogo raytracing extension

This package contains the NetLogo raytracing extension, which provides an interface with the popular open-source POV-Ray ray tracing rendering engine.

## Using

See the documentation in the included file raytracing.html.

## Building

Use the NETLOGO environment variable to tell the Makefile where to find the NetLogo.jar to compile against.  For example:

    NETLOGO=/Applications/NetLogo\\\ 5.0beta2 make raytracing.zip

If compilation succeeds, `raytracing.jar` and `raytracing.zip` (containing everything needed to distribute the extension) should be created.


## Credits

The idea for the raytracing extension was conceived by Forrest Stonedahl, and the first version was implemented in an independent study course project by Rumou Duan at Northwestern University, under the supervision of Forrest Stonedahl and Uri Wilensky.

The raytracing extension makes use of the POV-Ray rendering engine, which must be downloaded and installed separately (see http://www.povray.org/ )
