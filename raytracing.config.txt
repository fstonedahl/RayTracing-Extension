# Unless the POV-Ray executable is in your PATH, you should 
# set povray_executable to point to the full path of the program.
#
# * On Windows, this path may look like: 
#   C:/Program Files/POV-Ray/v3.7/bin/pvengine64.exe
#  IMPORTANT: 
#    Use forward slashes / instead of \ in your path!
#
# * On Linux, you can likely just set it to "povray"
povray_executable=povray
#povray_options=-D

#Right now, there aren't any other options to set...
